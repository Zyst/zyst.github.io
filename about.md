Hello there! I'm Erick Romero, I last worked at [Iris B2B Applications][1] as a C# Consultant.

Iâ€™m finishing up University at [Tecmilenio][2].

Experienced with Spring MVC, Spring Boot. More recently I've been falling in love with ASP.NET MVC and Web API.

I have experience creating and modifying online Mexican invoice systems compliant with SAT requirements, MEAN Stack development both on Front end and Back end, front end design and connection to RESTful backends mainly using AngularJS, and full Database encryption implementations for highly critical financial data.

My current Goals are deepening my C# knowledge, and continuing to contribute to the jHipster codebase, which I've recently fallen in love with.

As for my hobbies, I like answering questions on Stack Overflow, playing videogames (Currently playing Final Fantasy XIV), and I'm teaching myself piano in the downtime.

I love learning, and also spreading the love once I find out something that could be hard or complicated to find out otherwise, which is mostly what I'll be dropping in this blog.
