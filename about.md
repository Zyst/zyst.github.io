I’m an extremely quick learning, and passionate Full-Stack Web Developer
currently working with Iris B2B Applications.

I focus on JavaScript development particularly Node, and React. But I also have
a lot of experience with Angular 1.x. I’m highly results oriented, and have an
excellent track record translating big, sprawling concepts into clean Web Apps.

Currently I’m learning Go for highly performant concurrency/parallelism, and
learning how to develop Progressive Web Applications to push my front-end skills
to a higher level.

I love learning, and also spreading the love once I find out something that
could be hard or complicated to find out otherwise, that along with my musings
is what I'll be posting in this blog.
