# About

Hello there! I'm Erick Romero, I work at [iSAP Technologies][1] as the company Lead Software Developer.

Iâ€™m finishing up University at [Tecmilenio][2].

Experienced with JSF/JSP and more Recently Spring MVC and Spring Boot, online Mexican invoice systems compliant with SAT requirements, MEAN Stack development both on Front end and Back end, front end design and connection to RESTful backends mainly using AngularJS, and full Database encryption implementations for highly critical financial data.

My current Goals are deepening my Scala knowledge, and continuing to contribute to the jHipster codebase, which I've recently fallen in love with.

As for my hobbies, I like answering questions on Stack Overflow, playing videogames (Currently playing TERA), and I'm teaching myself piano in the downtime.

I love learning, and also spreading the love once I find out something that could be a pain to find out otherwise, which is mostly what I'll be dropping in this blog.
