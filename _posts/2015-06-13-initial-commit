It's an extremely common ocurrence. You want to find out how to do something, so you google it! Then you find this amazing blog post, and it covers everything you need to do. Amazing.

But sometimes you google, and once you reach page 3 of Google Search you realize you might be in uncharted territory, maybe not uncharted, maybe what you are finding is just not doing it for you. So you piece together from 10 different sources and a couple of Stack Overflow questions how to do what you want to do, success!

However, wouldn't it be a shame if that effort Googling weren't transmitted somehow? You spent a lot of time investigating, what if someone comes along a few days, weeks, years later and needs to do the same?

## Purpose

That is the purpose of this blog, I want to become the first kind of person. I want to become the kind of person who was the second, but didn't stop at learning it themselves, I want to transfer that knowledge. So whenever I find something that takes quite a bit of effort to answer with Googling I'll go ahead and investigate it, then I'll post it here, so you don't have to.

Look forward to it.
