Here are some commands, and a few other things I've found out as I mess around with OS X. I'm keeping the most remarkable here so I don't forget them.

## Navigate to directory

If you press: `Command + Shift + G` you can paste an entire directory to navigate directly to it.

<figure>
    <a href="/assets/images/posts/2016-02-16-useful-os-x-commands-and-more/ss1.png" target="_blank">
        <img src="/assets/images/posts/2016-02-16-useful-os-x-commands-and-more/ss1.png" alt="The criminal image in question"></img>
    </a>
</figure>

More to come soon as I keep finding them out!
