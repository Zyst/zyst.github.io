Here are some commands, and a few other things I've found out as I mess around with OS X. I'm keeping the most remarkable here so I don't forget them.

## Navigate to directory

If you press: `Command + Shift + G` you can paste an entire directory to navigate directly to it.

<figure>
    <a href="/assets/images/posts/2016-02-16-useful-os-x-commands-and-more/ss1.png" target="_blank">
        <img src="/assets/images/posts/2016-02-16-useful-os-x-commands-and-more/ss1.png" alt="The criminal image in question"></img>
    </a>
</figure>

## Screenshots

Multi Screen Screenshot is done with `Command + Shift + 3`, this one kind of sucks with multiple monitors. In general just use `Command + Shift + 4`, it lets you select an area, but if while you have the area select going you press `Space` it will let you select a Window instead. 

The two above have puush auto hooks.

More to come soon as I keep finding them out!
