[Clearly][1] is a super useful tool for reading online content. However, it has a sidebar that takes away valuable empty space, here's a guide on how to remove it.

Then travel to the 'Custom Theme' tab, click on the 'Custom CSS' box and add the following: `#sidebar { display: none; } #background { right: 0px !important; }`
