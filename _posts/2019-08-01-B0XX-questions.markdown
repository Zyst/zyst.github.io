I had some questions when I got my B0XX. I figured it'd be a good idea to document the answers, so they might help someone else someday. If that's you, hope this helps!

## Is aerial movement meant to be done with full left/right or modifiers + left/right?

Hax said that there's pretty much no need to do modifier drifting.

## Is there a way to have dolphin detect the b0xx even when tabbed out when using native controller inputs?

Yes. Under controller settings turn on background input:

## Is full dash over mod (Instead of walk) normal?

Yes. Section 9.1 of the [Melee manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19N_qIS5ummLIFJF-00w72lxOuE3tHMqX/view) goes over this. When holding both left and right the modifier will not trigger a walk, for ledgedashing purposes.

## Do armrests suck for box?

Yeah, if your chair supports it lower them as much as possible.
